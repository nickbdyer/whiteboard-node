#Websockets Whiteboard

Week 8 at Makers Academy

###Technologies

- Socket.io
- VIM

###Notes

This project was a small project over a couple of days trying to get
a whiteboard setup with socket.io. It also was the start of my journey into
using the VIm text editor.

###Lessons Learned

- I could not find any really great tutorials on setting up a whiteboard at the
  time, but I do at least understand the concept of how they work now using the
  html5 <canvas> tag and socket.io to send locations on clicks.
