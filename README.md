#Websockets Whiteboard

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/nickbdyer/whiteboard-node/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/nickbdyer/whiteboard-node)

Week 8 at Makers Academy

###Technologies

- Socket.io
- VIM

###Notes

This project was a small project over a couple of days trying to get
a whiteboard setup with socket.io. It also was the start of my journey into
using the VIm text editor.

###Images

The canvas is currently setup to take up the whole browser, and as such an image
would either be a blank page, or some horrendous drawing I completed with
an apple trackpad. I have opted to show neither.

###Lessons Learned

- I could not find any really great tutorials on setting up a whiteboard at the
  time, but I do at least understand the concept of how they work now using the
  html5 canvas tag and socket.io to send locations on clicks.
